A few months ago I was investigating some digital signage solutions for work and came across a lot of resources and options that didn't fully fit the restrictive conditions I needed to produce a solution in. That aside, something like this would be helpful on *the commune* so I built an in-house solution.

# Part 1 : Hardware

Obviously we're using an army Raspberry Pi microcomputers to do this. Who do you think I am?

The plan was to set up 2 different TVs. The screens we picked up were some old samsung TVs. They aren't smart or anything, so can't use the smart things IoT app or anything, but that's good because (and I may have mentioned this before) Raspberry Pi. 

These TVs are good because they will a) support Raspberry Pi input through HDMI, b) can we set up to support WOL which is a feature we want for automation and energy efficiency, and c) have a USB port that can power a Pi.

The Pis we're using are Raspberry Pi Model 3 B+. We've picked to use these because I had one spare that hadn't been used in my cluster, and I was able to pick up a 2nd on ebay for Â£18. The 3 B+ is a high enough spec to run a Linux distro with a GUI that can display 1080p images with ease, and will be able to fetch remote images easily. 

The Pi 3 B+ can apparently be boosted to support 4k output, but we'll have to see how that goes later.

# Part 2 : Pi Setup

First things first, configuring the Pi. These machines are running standard 64-bit Raspbian with full GUI. After going through a very basic install using the RPi imager for Windows, I had the two devices up and running.

Before actually making any software, we need to make sure that these are 1) Set up with a static IP, 2) have python installed and updated, 3) have reboots configued (as they'll be 'always-on' machines), and 4) are mounted with both ethernet and power.

## 1. Setting up a static IP

Setting a static IP on the Pi is done through DHCP. If you have a private DHCP server it can be done there, but for us we have a lovely switch on our router saying "use this router as a DHCP server", so that's nice and easy.

1\. Load the machine locally, with a mouse and keyboard and a monitor, so you can open up a console.

2\. run `ifconfig` to get all your interface info.

3\. find the linesstarting `inet` and `ether` for the interface you want.

{% highlight console %}
[Interface]:
    inet xx.xx.xx.xx  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.0.255
    ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
{% endhighlight %}

These numbers are your `ip address` and `mac address` respectively, and can be used to set up your machine in DHCP.

4\. log into your DHCP server and set up your IP reservations. I'm happy to stick with the IP I was assigned by default.

Once these steps are done, you'll need to reboot your machine to make sure that static IP is set.

## 2. Have Python installed and updated

Now that an IP is set we can put away this yucky UI and get out the beatiful terminal.

0\. Bonus step I'm adding in after the fact - it may be helpful to run `sudo apt update` before the install of python to make sure you've got all the required modules to actually build python

`sudo apt install build-essential zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev  libsqlite3-dev`

1\. Run `python --version` to see what version we have installed. We've got 3.11.2 which should be plenty for what we want to run, but we're going to upgrade to 3.12 to be safe.

2\. Download the most up-to-date version of python by running `wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.4/Python-3.12.4.tgz` 

3\. This will download the tar file, so we need to extract this using `tar -xf Python-3.12.4.tgz`

4\. Now we've got this extracted we can delete the tar file and cd into the directory

{% highlight console %}
Jamie@SensiblyNamedPi-1:~ $ rm Python-3.12.4.tgz
Jamie@SensiblyNamedPi-1:~ $ cd Python-3.12.4/
Jamie@SensiblyNamedPi-1:~/Python-3.12.4 $
{% endhighlight %}

5\. run `./configure --enable-optimizations` and wait for the installer to check over the system and prepare the file system

6\. run `sudo make  && sudo make altinstall` to install the python version onto the Pi

7\. this will have installed python with the execute call being `python3.12`. You can test this by running `python --version` This is fine, and we can just set our lines to run like that if we want, or we can set it to run 3.12 when we just call `python` normally. 

The remaining steps here are optional:

8\. remove any existing softlink to the python bin by running `sudo rm /usr/local/bin/python` 

9\. replace the softlink to your new version by running `sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/python3.12 /usr/local/bin/python`

## 3. Reboots

Oh reboots, my best friend. The saviour of all. Fixer of 99% of the issues I've had with any machine. Turns out machines that aren't designed to be always-on should't be always-on, and the Pi is no exception.

I've set up reboots on linux machines before so it's as simple as running `sudo nano /etc/crontab` and adding a new line for the reboot

I like to do reboots at 4am as that is definitely the deadest time. We have people up until 3am sometimes, and people awake at 5am sometimes, so 4am is a nice middle ground. Not that these digital signage machines really care about the time they reboot as long as it's not mid-day

I have added a new crontab line very simply

`0  4    * * *   root    reboot`

## 4. Mounting, Ethernet, and Power

We've fed an ethernet cable from the nearest port to the TV, hiding it in the cornice so it looks nice.

Power to the TV comes from a cable attached to the wall under a plastic sheath, and the power to the pi comes directly from the TV.

To mounth the Pi to the TV, I've 3d-printed a small basket which hooks onto the mounth we've used to attach the TV to the wall.

# Part 3 : The Code

So how is this going to work?
